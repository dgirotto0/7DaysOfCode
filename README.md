# #7DaysOfCode - Alura

##This exercise was provided by Alura, conducted by instructor Rafa Ballerini.

### Day 1
On the first day, an exercise was proposed where the user has to compare two variables regardless of their type and print the correct message:

As vari√°veis x e y tem o mesmo valor, mas tipos diferentes

So, to do this I just have to use the correct comparison. 
If you type '===' you will be comparing the value of the variable and the type. In this case it is necessary to use '==' which compares only the value.

'==' : equal to
'===' : identical to*
