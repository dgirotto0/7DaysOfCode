# #7DaysOfCode - Alura

This exercise was provided by Alura, conducted by instructor Rafa Ballerini.

### Day 1
On the first day, an exercise was proposed where the user has to compare two variables regardless of their type and print the correct message.

To achieve this, I just have to use the correct comparison operator.
If you use '===' you will be comparing both the value and the type of the variables. However, in this case, it is necessary to use '==' which compares only the value.

'==' : equal to

'===' : identical to

### Day 2

On the second day, an exercise was proposed where the program prompts the user for some information and returns it concatenated in a sentence.

This code prompts the user for their name, age, and the programming language they are studying. It then prints a message greeting the user with this information.
After one second, it asks if the user likes studying the specified language and provides responses based on the user's choice.
